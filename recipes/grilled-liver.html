    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This classic Persian grilled lamb's liver (Jigar Kababi) is a simple,
      delicious, and incredibly popular dish in Iran. It's often preferred over
      the pan-fried version for its smoky flavor and easy preparation. Rich in
      iron, it's a fantastic choice for a nutritious and flavorful meal cooked
      right on the grill.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong
      ><em> this recipe yields <strong>4-6 servings</strong></em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb (about 500g) lamb's liver</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the liver under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut it
        into uniform, bite-sized cubes, about 1-inch pieces. Be sure not to cut
        them too small as they may fall off the skewers.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the liver cubes, sliced onion, lemon juice,
        salt, and pepper. Mix well to ensure the liver is evenly coated with the
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to
        allow the flavors to meld and the liver to become tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the mixture from the refrigerator. Thread the liver pieces onto
        metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers. You can discard the onion slices or
        alternate them with the liver pieces on the skewers if you enjoy grilled
        onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your grill to a medium heat. Place the skewers on the grill and
        cook for about 3-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through but still
        tender. Be careful not to overcook, as liver can become tough and dry
        very quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately with fresh bread (like flatbread), grilled tomatoes,
        and fresh herbs.
      </li>
    </ol>
